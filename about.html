        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm Venkata Hardik, a second-year B.Tech Computer Science Engineering student at SRM Ramapuram. With a passion for coding and a drive to become a full-stack developer, I'm constantly learning new technologies to create innovative solutions.</p>
        <p>I have hands-on experience with programming languages such as C, C++, Python, Java, and web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I'm also skilled in UI/UX prototyping using Figma and have developed projects such as a website blocker and an expense tracker.</p>
        <p>Apart from tech, I'm deeply interested in the aviation field, and I bring strong teamwork, communication, and problem-solving skills to everything I do. I'm always looking for opportunities to collaborate and grow in my journey toward making a positive impact on society through technology.</p>
